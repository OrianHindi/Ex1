Task 1 – Read me 


On our task we improved and expanded our last task number 0, We included support for general mathematical functions, Complex functions, file saving and display in a graphical window. This task uses the class we wrote in the previous assignment number 0, we updated our classes because of changes in the interfaces. 

At first, we implement the Junit classes which is test our functions in our project. We have testing of: Complex function, functions gui, Monom and Polynom. 
In each function-test we did "expected answers" and answers that we were given as a result from our functions. If the answers were equals the test were succeeded, else, the test fail. 

Then, we updated classes Monom and Polynom as a result of the changes in the interfaces function and polynom able. For example: function equals gets polynom able in task number 0, and now in task number 1 it gets Object, so we did the changes. 
 
Later, we did class ComplexFunction that implements complex_function. Complex function is build as a tree. Its root is operation like: Mul, Div, Plus and more. Its left child is a function/complex function/polynom/mono as well as its right child. In the class we did functions such as: plus, mul, div, max that puts those operations in the root. 

Functions gui class implements interface functions that represents a collection of functions that can save them in a file, upload a file and display in a graphical window. We used library StdDraw. We did functions such as: saveToFile, drwaFunctions – by given params it draw the fuction in graphical window and more. 
 
We enjoyed doing our task and did our best. The work was interesting, and we enjoyed learning new things. We approved our programming and learn about interface, inheritance, functions gui, Junit and more. We worked together and strengthened each other
